# Pong-Game
Add and improve to Pong game already started by Joe. The code cloned from Joe is a work in progress and the game isn't playable.
The main goal is to make the game run seamlessly with no apparent issues.  
Then if I have enough time, I also plan to add some neat features that don’t already exist in the code.
